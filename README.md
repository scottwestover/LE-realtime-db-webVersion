# Real Time Dashboard

This is a sample Real Time Dashboard that can be built using the Real Time Operational APIs from LiveEngage. The app also uses the Skills, Users, and Agent Groups APIs to pull in relevant information. This was app was built using NodeJS and Angular.

## Instructions

In order to properly use the app, you will need to enable the Real Time Operational, Skills, Users, and Agent Groups APIs on your account. If the Users, SKills, and Agent Groups APIs are not enabled, then the tool will not pull data correctly.

You can navigate to the messaging dashboard by clicking on the icon on the navbar.

You can add/edit your api keys in LiveEngage by going to the campaigns tab, click on data sources at the bottom, and then click on the api tab.
